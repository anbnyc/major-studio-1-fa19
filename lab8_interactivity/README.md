## Lab 8: Interactivity

This lab demonstrates filter, select, and hover behavior with a simple D3 visualization. This also shows how to use a `state` variable to keep track of your data.

### Activity

- 10 minutes: read through the code. Try to focus on the order in which code is _executed_, not necessarily the order in which it is written.

- 15 minutes: discussion and questions about the code

- 15 minutes: add new features together

### To-Do List

[ ] Use destructuring to get variables off state
[ ] Add transitions on enter/exit
[ ] Add a window.resize event listener
[ ] Add CSS to style tooltip and menus
